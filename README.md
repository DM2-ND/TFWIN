Abstract:
In the era of big data, structured databases usually contain conflicts among the information coming from different sources. Truth discovery, that is to integrate multi-source noisy information by estimating the reliability of each source, has emerged as a hot topic. However, existing truth discovery methods cannot handle unstructured data for discovering temporal facts from text corpus because of two challenges, bridging structure gap and de ning conflicts among extractions. In this work, we first use textual pattern mining to structure the text data and investigate the reliability of the patterns as information sources. Second, since the single truth assumption is no longer valid for multi-value facts (like country’s presidents), we derive the World’s invariants including time-relevant and time-irrelevant constraints to find conflicts. Third, we propose a novel truth  nding framework that can estimate pa ern reliability and infer the trustworthiness of noisy fact tuples. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework on the task of temporal fact extraction from unstructured data.
