# Overview

In this work, we proposed an unsupervised approach of two modules that mutually enhance each other: one is a reliability estimator on fact extractors conditionally to the temporal contexts; the other is a fact trustworthiness estimator based on the extractorâ€™s reliability. The iterative learning process reduces the noise of the extractions. 

# Data
This folder "data" contains 4 structured datasets for termpoal facts extraction. 

data_post_CP: country's president data with post time signal    
data_post_SP: sport's player data with post time signal     
data_text_CP: country's president data with text time signal    
data_text_CP: sport's player data with text time signal    

Format of these four datasets are same, for each line:  
```
RANKPATTERN \t PATTERN \t ENTITYPOS \t VALUEPOS \t RANKENTITYVALUETM \t ENTITY \t VALUE \t TM \t COUNT
```

Besides, ground truth for "country's president" is collected in "groundtruth_president". 

# Codes 
The source codes of our models are in "tfwin.py", run with python 2.7
